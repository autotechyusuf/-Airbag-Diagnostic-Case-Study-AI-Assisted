Airbag-Diagnostic-Case-Study-AI-Assisted
This case study outlines a real-world diagnostic scenario involving a persistent airbag system fault. Traditional methods failed to resolve the issue after weeks of effort. Using a combination of professional scan tools and AI-assisted troubleshooting, I identified and resolved a hidden firmware mismatch that restored full system functionality.
Problem : A 2015 Honda Accord had an unresolved airbag light and system fault that persisted after module replacement. No clear DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Codes) pointed to the actual issue.
Tools Used - Autel MaxiSys Elite - Honda HDS Software - OEM Wiring Diagrams- AI Assistant (ChatGPT) for data analysis and code pattern comparison
Solution: After traditional diagnostics failed, I exported the scan tool logs and used AI to compare symptoms with other reported cases. The analysis pointed to a possible firmware mismatch between the new airbag module and the vehicle's original ECU. Using HDS, I reprogrammed the SRS module with the correct firmware version. The fault cleared and the airbag system passed all functional tests.
Outcome: 
- Issue resolved after 3+ weeks of failed attempts by others  
- No unnecessary parts replaced  
- AI-assisted analysis led to a precise, cost-effective solution  
- Reinforced the value of blending hands-on diagnostics with AI tools
